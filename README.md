# Machine Learning

Fundamental of machine learning: Study cases and implementations.

## [Machine Learning by Andre Ng at Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)

If you getting started with Machine Learning, then this course may be perfect option as starting point. It lot of mathematical rigor, but you will found out that all of them are very fundametal. Honestly, if you successful at abstraction level using mathematic, then you can go ahead easily into practical solution using [Tensor Flow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) or [Scikit Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/).

Here the tapology:

1. [Intoduction](coursera/machine-learning-standford-univerity/Introduction)

    This section contains refreshness for Linear Algebra and introduce important concept for model evaluation.

2. [Linear Regression with Multiple Variables](coursera/machine-learning-standford-univerity/Linear%20Regression%20with%20Multiple%20Variables)

    This section will be most important topic in the course. Learning linear regression is the key to understand mathematical model used in statistical world. Linear regression is oldest mathematical model which is very matured and still used until today for social research and forecasting in economic.

3. [Logistic Regression](coursera/machine-learning-standford-univerity/Logistic%20Regression)

    Logistic regression is critical concept developed from the idea of linear Regression. It used in both social science, computer science and engineering. If you are interesting in computer field, than I am encourage you to working with [percoloation problem in algorithm course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/programming/Lhp5z/percolation) to get the bg picture.

4. [Neural Network](coursera/machine-learning-standford-univerity/Neural%20Network)

    Neural network is most popular and widely used model to solve almost any problems. But, hold on, Neural Network itself tend to be independent field beyod machine learning since Neural Network can be mixed with broad concept in Artificial Intelligence, Neuro Science, and Deep Learning. But, it's worthy to learn it from the basic level.

5. [Support Vector Machine](coursera/machine-learning-standford-univerity/Support%20Vector%20Machine)

    Support vector machine is a model which is purely taken from linear algebra. The idea behind support vector machine is applying statictical concepts in linear algebra manner.

6. [Unsupervised Learning](coursera/machine-learning-standford-univerity/Unsupervised%20Learning)

    Unsupervised learning is hot topic in machine learning because the goal is to automate data labeling. Keep in mind that such automation is very hard to do, so you need some tricky techniques.

7. [Anomaly Detection](coursera/machine-learning-standford-univerity/Anomaly%20Detection)

    Anomaly detection is most practical implementation of support vector machine. It is widely used in industry and social science to detect fault and surely, anomalies.
