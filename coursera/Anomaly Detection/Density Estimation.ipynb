    "## Problem Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like in other learning problems, we are given a dataset  \\\\({x^{(1)}, x^{(2)},\\dots,x^{(m)}}\\\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "We are then given a new example, \\\\(x_{test}\\\\), and we want to know whether this new example is abnormal/anomalous.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define a \"model\" \\\\(p(x)\\\\) that tells us the probability the example is not anomalous. We also use a threshold ϵ (epsilon) as a dividing line so we can say which examples are anomalous and which are not.\n",
    "\n",
    "A very common application of anomaly detection is **detecting fraud**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* \\\\(x^{(i)}\\\\) =  features of user i's activities\n",
    "* Model \\\\(p(x)\\\\) from the data.\n",
    "* Identify unusual users by checking which have p(x)<ϵ.\n",
    "\n",
    "If our anomaly detector is flagging **too many** anomalous examples, then we need to **decrease** our threshold ϵ\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gaussian Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gaussian Distribution is a familiar bell-shaped curve that can be described by a function \\\\(\\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let x∈ℝ. If the probability distribution of x is Gaussian with mean μ, variance \\\\(\\sigma^2\\\\), then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The little ∼ or 'tilde' can be read as \"distributed as.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gaussian Distribution is parameterized by a mean and a variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mu, or μ, describes the center of the curve, called the mean. The width of the curve is described by sigma, or σ, called the standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full function is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large p(x;\\mu,\\sigma^2) = \\dfrac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{(2\\pi)}}e^{-\\dfrac{1}{2}(\\dfrac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma})^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can estimate the parameter μ from a given dataset by simply taking the average of all the examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mu = \\dfrac{1}{m}\\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^m x^{(i)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can estimate the other parameter, \\\\(\\sigma^2\\\\), with our familiar squared error formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma^2 = \\dfrac{1}{m}\\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^m(x^{(i)} - \\mu)^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a training set of examples, \\\\(\\lbrace x^{(1)},\\dots,x^{(m)}\\rbrace\\\\) where each example is a vector, \\\\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(x) = p(x_1;\\mu_1,\\sigma_1^2)p(x_2;\\mu_2,\\sigma^2_2)\\cdots p(x_n;\\mu_n,\\sigma^2_n)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics, this is called an \"independence assumption\" on the values of the features inside training example x.\n",
    "\n",
    "More compactly, the above expression can be written as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(x) = = \\displaystyle \\prod^n_{j=1} p(x_j;\\mu_j,\\sigma_j^2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### The algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose features \\\\(X_i\\\\) that you think might be indicative of anomalous examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Fit parameters \\\\(\\mu_1,\\dots,\\mu_n,\\sigma_1^2,\\dots,\\sigma_n^2\\\\)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Calculate \\\\(\\mu_j = \\dfrac{1}{m}\\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^m x_j^{(i)}\\\\)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Calculate \\\\(\\sigma^2_j = \\dfrac{1}{m}\\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^m(x_j^{(i)} - \\mu_j)^2\\\\)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Given a new example x, compute p(x):\n",
    "$$p(x) = \\displaystyle \\prod^n_{j=1} p(x_j;\\mu_j,\\sigma_j^2) = \\prod\\limits^n_{j=1} \\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma_j}exp(-\\dfrac{(x_j - \\mu_j)^2}{2\\sigma^2_j})$$\n",
    "Anomaly if p(x)<ϵ<br>\n",
    "A vectorized version of the calculation for μ is \\\\(\\mu = \\dfrac{1}{m}\\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^m x^{(i)}\\\\). You can vectorize \\\\(\\sigma^2\\\\) similarly."
