    "There are at least two useful steps to ensuring that we can get a lots of **high quality** data and **minimizing the effort** to get bigger dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ensure that we have a **low bias classifier** before expanding data. With low bias classifier, we can produce high quality artificial dataset that have crucial impact on training algorithm<br>\n",
    "For example:<br>\n",

    "2. Estimate how much work would it be to get bigger dataset. For example: If we need 10x larger dataset, then it is would be nice if we can get it within a days and do labeling at least 10 second for each data on average.\n",
