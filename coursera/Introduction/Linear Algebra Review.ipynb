    "The identity matrix, when multiplied by any matrix of the same dimensions, results in the original matrix. It's just like multiplying numbers by 1. The identity matrix simply has 1's on the diagonal (upper left to lower right diagonal) and 0's elsewhere.\n",

    "## Inverse and Transpose\n",

    "The inverse of a matrix A is denoted \\\\(A^{-1}\\\\). Multiplying by the inverse results in the identity matrix.\n",

    "A non square matrix does not have an inverse matrix. We can compute inverses of matrices in octave with the \\\\(pinv(A)\\\\) function and in Matlab with the \\\\(inv(A)\\\\) function. Matrices that don't have an inverse are singular or degenerate.\n",
