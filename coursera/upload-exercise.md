## Upload the Programming Exercises to MATLAB Online

The Machine Learning programming exercises consist of code files, data files, and instructions. They are each provided as a compressed .zip file. In order to upload the programming exercises to MATLAB Online, complete the following steps:

1. Download the programming exercise .zip file, e.g. machine-learning-exn.zip (where n is the exercise number).

2. Log in to MATLAB Online, then drag and drop the exercise .zip file into your Current Folder (or use the ‘Upload’ button in the Home tab).*

3. Enter and run the following command at the command line to unzip the exercise folder: unzip machine-learning-exn; (replace the n with the exercise number)

5. Confirm the exercise folder was unzipped correctly, then delete the zip file.

6. Right-click the unzipped machine-learning-exn folder, and select 'Remove from Path -> Selected Folder and Subfolders'. This is to prevent MATLAB from using incorrect files from another exercise folder.

*Unzipping the homework files on your computer and uploading the files individually to MATLAB Online is not recommended.
