    "### Operational Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "A way of turning construct into variables we can measure or turning any construct definition into measurable unit. For example: Gram of eaten food each day to measure hungry, number of plausible statements to measure anger and how many smile each day to measure happiness.\n",

    "### Blinding\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of group comparison, **Blind** is an objective to make all group believe they were treated with same treatment. For example, in the case of A/B product testing: Group A given with all new brand catalog information, while group B given 'not new' brand catalog, but we said to all of them that it is new product catalog with special discount.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Double blinding** is an objective to make both studied group and researcher blind with the observation. For example, in the case of A/B product testing, researcher only focused to gathering data without concerning to observe quality of response."
